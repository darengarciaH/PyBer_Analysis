# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
For this analysis of PyBer data, we will be creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, which includes three categories: urban, suburban, and rural. We will be obtaining metrics, such as the total driver count, the sum of fares, and the total number of rides grouped by these three different city types. Then, we will be creating a multiple line plot that shows the total weekly fares for each of the three city types.
## Results
## Summary Statistics
For our analysis on ride-sharing data, we reach several conclusions. Total fares are about $63,000 per our analysis, with around $39,000 coming from urban fares, around $19,000 coming from suburban fares, and only $4,000 coming from rural fares, showing that urban fares bring in more than half of Pyber's revenue for this analysis. The total ride count in urban areas (1,625) exceeds that of suburban areas (625) by more than twofold, and exceeds that of rural areas (125) by more than tenfold. As a result, driver count is also higher in urban cities (2,405), followed by suburban (490) and rural areas (78) sequentially. Only in urban cities do we see that there is a higher number of drivers than there is total rides. However, we see that the average fare for urban cities is at about $24.53, and is lower than that of suburban areas (about $30.97) and rural areas (about $34.62). This is intuitive given the considerably lower number of drivers in the area. As a result, rural drivers will obtain an average fare of more than $55, which exceeds the urban driver average fare by more than threefold, at slightly over $16 per ride.

### Multiple Line Graph, January 2019 to April 2019
As for our multiple line plot, we collect ride data from January 2019 to April 2019. The results remain similar: urban cities collect a greater total of fares than do suburban and rural cities. Rural cities bring in the lowest fare revenue for Pyber, while suburban cities rank above rural cities for this analysis as well.

## Summary
The lack of drivers available in rural cities in particular contribute to the higher average ride fares compared to urban cities, which can make PyBer unattrative here. Suburban areas have more activity than rural areas, but not as many as urban areas. However, they benefit more from their proximity to urban areas. Therefore, in rural areas, it becomes more expensive to keep up with costs associated with rides. Rides in rural areas might also involve further distances given the nature of rural areas and particular commutes to suburban or urban areas. Consequentially, here are three business proposals to address these disparities:

* Transferring some urban drivers to suburban and rural areas might lower average fares, making rides more financially appealing to customers and raising revenue in these sectors. This is given that the amount of drivers in urban areas exceed the number of rides, creating a surplus that can be redistributed.
* Incentive pay for drivers working in remote areas can make employment opportunities in rural and suburban areas more attractive, therefore raising the number of drivers in these areas and potentially lowering the average fare in these areas and making them more cost-accessible for people in these areas.
* Obtaining data on average ride distance and average gas prices by city type might allow PyBer to better gauge costs associated for PyBer drivers, which can better quantify the previous two recommendations, making it easier to make a business decision on the matter.
