# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
For this analysis of PyBer data, we will be creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, which includes three categories: urban, suburban, and rural. We will be obtaining metrics, such as the total driver count, the sum of fares, and the total number of rides grouped by these three different city types. Then, we will be creating a multiple line plot that shows the total weekly fares for each of the three city types.
## Results
For our analysis on ride-sharing data, we reach several conclusions. The total count of rides in urban areas exceeds that of suburban areas by more than twofold, and exceeds that of rural areas by more than tenfold. Only in urban cities do we see that there is a higher number of drivers than there is total rides. However, we see that the average fare for urban cities is considerably lower than that of suburban and rural areas, with rural areas being the most expensive on average. This is intuitive given the considerably lower number of drivers in the area. As a result, rural drivers will obtain an average fare of more than $55, which exceeds the urban driver average fare by more than threefold, at slightly over $16 per ride.

As for our multiple line plot, we collect ride data from January 2019 to April 2019. The results remain similar. Urban cities collect a greater total of fares than do suburban and rural cities.
